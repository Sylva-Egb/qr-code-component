## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

By working on this first challenge, I have learnt how to center a div element, vertically and horizontally. For a backend developer this new lerning is so great

### Continued development

For the future projects, I want to deeply understand how to deal with the css properties that center a div

### Useful resources

- [How to do a card in css](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
